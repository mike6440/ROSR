This is the raw record that comes from the ROSRapproximately each 2 sec. The new 
format (3) has the following enhancements:
1. Header now includes serial number, format ID and software version number.
2. The "REF" field provides the KT15 internal reference temperature.
3. The miscellaneous temperatures, Tktcase, Twin, etc. are reported to 0.01C.
