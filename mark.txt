Hi Mark,

I am taking time during this period to do some old chores. Here is a summary of the data we have archived from AtA. I had the greatest difficulty explaining to people that the observations were made we each a tiny part of a global network of observations. This is true of the everything. There was no firm scientific goal. That would be terribly difficult for a boat that was continuously moving around. And it will just as difficult for a second AtA cruise. That's not to say that observations are not valuable. They are important because their uniqueness. An important consideration is that every observation needs to be accurate. Calibrations are crucial.

Anyway, this is the archive. By the way, this company is active in ocean observations.
